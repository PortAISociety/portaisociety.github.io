    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A comparator compares two values and returns a boolean value as to whether the statement is true or false. The different comparators are equal to (==), not equal to (!=), less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), and greater than or equal to (>=). If-statements allow you to selectively trigger code and create branching programs. While loops allow you to loop over a section of code until a condition is no longer true. You create an infinite loop by using a condition that is never false for the loop, which is a bad idea.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Example if-statement
name = input("What is your name? ")

if name == "Sam":
print("Hello, Sam!")

elif name == "Carmen":
print("Welcome, Carmen!")

elif name == "Geralt":
print("Welcome, Gwynbleidd")

elif name == "Dovahkiin":
print("I used to be an adventurer like you...")

else:
print("I don't recognise that name...")

print("Nice to meet you.")
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Example while-loop
count = 0
while count <= 10:
if count == 5:
print(count)
else:
print("hi")

count = count + 1

print("The loop is broken!")
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Example of nested loops
count = 0
i = 0
while count <= 5:
if count == 5:
while i < 3:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("spinning")
count = count + 1
print("Finished spinning!")
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Example of break keyword
count = 0
while True:
print("Help!")
count = count + 1
if count == 20:
break
print("Thanks for saving me!")
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Are you a cat person or a dog person? Is your user? Create a program that asks the user whether they prefer cats or dogs and tells them if you agree.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You are designing a system to protect the secret ingredient of your favourite recipe and have decided a password would protect it best. Create a program that, while the user gets the password wrong, they canâ€™t see the secret.</p>
            <p>Hint: You can update variables from outside the loop inside the loop.</p>
