    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A dictionary is a collection of keys and values that allow you to quickly and directly reference information. Dictionaries are defined using curly brackets, and are referenced in the same way as lists but using keys instead of index numbers.</p>
    <p>An object is a store for data and functions. The data is specific to the object and cannot be accessed directly outside of it. An object is defined using the ‘class’ keyword.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Class example
class Item(object):
def __init__(self, name, parts, cost_per_part):
self.name = name
self.parts = parts
self.cost_per_part = cost_per_part
self.age = 0

def get_name(self):
return self.name

def get_cost(self, discount):
total = self.cost_per_part * self.parts * discount
return total

def set_parts(self, new_parts):
self.parts = new_parts

    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Santa Claus has to deliver presents to a lot of children on Christmas Night. Each child has a name and age, and is allowed one present, which they have politely written to him to ask for. Santa also needs to keep track of whether they’ve been naughty or nice and whether he’s visited them yet. Create a class to help Santa keep track of all this information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once Santa has visited a child, he needs to be able to tick them off his list. Create a function within the class you have just made to mark off when he’s visited that child.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Finally, all these children need to be put on a list for Santa to check once or twice whilst out on deliveries. But a list would be too long to search through. Make a dictionary to hold his list and populate it with children. What could the key be for each child value?</p>
