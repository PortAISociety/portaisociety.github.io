    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>A list is an ordered set of data, all of the same type. You create a list by defining a variable as being equal to a set of open and closed brackets. To access the data inside a list, you reference the index of the data you want. The append and remove functions are used to add and remove values from a list respectively.</p>
    <p>A for loop is used to iterate over a data set a finite number of times to perform actions on the data within the data set.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Declaration examples
hopes_and_dreams = []

shopping = ["apples", "bleach", "cable ties"]

important_numbers = [42, 69, 420, 34]
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Referencing examples
print(important_numbers[0])
print(important_numbers[2])
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Appending example
hopes_and_dreams.append("to be happy")

# Removing example
shopping.remove("apples")

# Value alteration example
shopping[0] = "oranges"
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Checking for value
if "bleach" in shopping:
print("That's a lot of bleach you've got there...")

if "apples" not in shopping:
print("You really need to eat more healthily")
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Iteration example
for item in shopping:
print(item)
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# Complex iteration example
for x in range(0, len(shopping)):
print(x, shopping[x])
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>A burglar is robbing a house. He already has a few things in his sack: diamonds, a candlestick, and a wallet. Create a list to represent his sack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The burglar continues to search the house. He decides the candlestick is worthless and replaces it with a 42-inch plasma TV. Using append and remove, update your virtual sack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The burglar’s sack rips! Write a program that outputs all the items that fall on the floor with the word “smash!” next to each one.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
