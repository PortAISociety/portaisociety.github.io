    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Programming languages are designed to help humans write instructions, or algorithms for computers to understand. Like any language, programming languages have a vocabulary and syntax, which must be used correctly for your code to run properly. To help you with this, it is best to use an IDE, or integrated development environment, which will help you write code by using pretty print and shortcuts.</p>
    <p>Python is an interpreted language, meaning it is run one line at a time. This means it can be used for quickly writing and testing code. One way to test Python code is through the shell.</p>
    <p>There are different data types used by computers: Characters, strings, booleans, floats, and integers. Floats and integers can be manipulated using mathematical operators: +, -, *, /, and **. If you mis-write an operation, a logical error will occur. However, if you try and use these on anything but a numerical data type, a syntax error will occur.</p>
    <p>It is important to follow development standards so that other developers can more easily read your code.</p>
