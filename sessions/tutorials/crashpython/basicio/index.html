    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The print function allows you to output information to the shell. This can be hard-coded data, or it can be the contents of a variable. A variable is a temporary, named store for data that is disposed of once the program is finished. You can use the input function to get user input and store it in a variable.</p>
    
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
# The print function
print("hello")

# Defining variables
number = 42
string = "Password123"
not_a_number = "42"

# Getting user input
name = input("What is your name? ")
    </code></pre>
