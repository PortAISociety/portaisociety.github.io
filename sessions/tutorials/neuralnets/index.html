            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The aim of this sessio is to teach you about neural networks - simulated "brains" that learn what output is suitable by studying training data.</p>
            
            <h2>Installation & Setup</h2>
            <p>As always, we're using <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python3</a>. We will be using Python for the foreseeable future, so please ensure you have it installed.</p>
            <p>In this session we will be using two Pythonn libraries: TensorFlow and textgenrnn. Both can be installed from the command promp or terminal using the following commands:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">pip install tensorflow</code></pre>
            <pre><code class="language-">pip install textgenrnn</code></pre>
            <p>As always, if you run into issues when installing these libraries, please ask a committee member for help.</p>
            <p>You will also need to download some test data. This comes in the form of compressed text files which can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fMCYHBMB5YwU8khAdbXfbiBuprjPgE9y">from our Google Drive</a>. Please make sure to decompress the folder to an easy-to-reach location on your computer.</p>
            <p>This practical is based on the example code from <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn">the textgenrnn Github repository</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Last week we learned about decision trees - a structure that queries some input data with basic questions and decisions to produce a suitable output.</p>
            <p>This week, we're learning about neural networks, which are a step up from a decision tree. A neural network takes some input data and passes it through a series of "neurons" to produce some kind of output.</p>
            <p>Each neuron is actually a mathematical function that alters the input data. The result is then passed to the next neurons.</p>
            <p>To demonstrate, let's have a play with the textgenrnn library. textgenrnn is a simple-to-use library built using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>, two very well-known and versatile machine learning libraries.</p>
            <p>First you'll need to create a new Python file and import the textgenrnn class from the textgenrnn module.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
# Import textgenrnn from the module
from textgenrnn import textgenrnn
            </code></pre>
            <p>This will allow you to access the library's resources.</p>
            <p>Next, you need to create a new instance of the textgenrnn class. This is done very simply, as shown below. Remember to store it inside a variable, or it will not work.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
# Create an instance of the textgenrnn object
txtgn = textgenrnn()
            </code></pre>
            <p>Doing this creates a default neural network that can make very basic, but very random, decisions. Add the following code and then run the file to see what I mean.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
# Generate some text
txtgn.generate()
            </code></pre>
            <p>Well done! You have created your first neural net. But it outputs things like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-">
