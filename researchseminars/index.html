          <h3>Enabling local people and groups to support global organisational development</h3>
          <p>Our organisations emerge from networks of autonomous people engaged in interaction processes
            (Espejo &amp; Foss, 2018). People, in collectives, use their skills, resources and capabilities to create
            and produce whatever outcomes they may wish to achieve. Collaboration in these interactions, to a
            significant degree, depend on processes of self-organization. In general there is no one with
            authority to tell people what to do and how to interact; they just interact. Often these interactions are
            inadequate and it is only through learning processes, which depend on cues and signals, that they
            proceed towards desirable outcomes. To a degree this is the dynamics of organisational
            development to respond to environmental, social, and economic pressures. Self-organising
            processes are at the core of their interactions. In today’s world technologies, digital and others, are
            transforming these interaction processes. New forms of communication and relationships are
            emerging between people and their environments; these are processes towards the constitution of
            effective organisational systems (Beer, 1979, 1985), (Espejo &amp; Reyes, 2011). However, these
            systems are more than the outcome of bottom-up self-organisation; they are also, the outcome of
            guided self-organisation, which, through policies clarify purposes and help to speed up learning
            processes by enabling relating fragmented resources. Organisational development and problem
            solving require of both; bottom-up and top-down interactions. The challenge is working out which
            interaction strategies are necessary to increase response capacity to make sense of an often
            overwhelmingly complex surrounding. These are aspects related to Ross Ashby´s law of requisite
            variety (Ashby, 1964). We learn to manage these interactions often at a high cost to people and
            organisation; hierarchical structures tend to concentrate responses to environmental challenges at
            the top of the organisation. On the other hand heterarchical organisations try to distribute response
            capacity and self-organisation throughout the collective, but often their local response capacity is
            limited by resources. However, current information and communications technologies are increasing the
            chances of making this distribution effective.</p>

          <b>2019-2020: Research Seminar 1</b>
          <h3>On Minimisation of Treewidth and Fill-In</h3>
          <p>In graph theory, a chord is defined as an edge between a pair of non-adjacent vertices of a cycle. After the addition of a set of chords, a graph becomes triangulated if every cycle has a chord. In a minimal triangulation, the removal of any chord creates a chord-less cycle. First, we review some efficient algorithm for minimal triangulation.</p>
          <p>Second, we consider two well-studied problems in graph theory with various real-world applications. Both problems can be solved by finding specific triangulations of the input graph. The Minimum Fill-In problem is the problem of finding a triangulation with the minimum number of chords whereas the Treewidth problem corresponds to the problem of finding a triangulation such that the cliquesize (size of the largest set of pairwise adjacent vertices) is kept to a minimum. It has been proved that neither of the two problems can be solved efficiently. </p>
          <p>We overview the graph classes where the answer to the two problems differ and introduce a class of graphs that contains all the aforementioned classes. We then discuss the closely related TFM (the Treewidth and Fill-in Minimisation) problem where given a graph G, positive integers c and k the output is 'yes' if there exists a triangulation of G with cliquesize of at most k more than optimal, that has at most c many more chords than the minimum number of chords needed. We point out the values of k and c for which the TFM problem has a positive answer in our class of graphs. Finally we study some well-known graph classes where we believe the TFM problem has a positive solution for any c and k.</p>
