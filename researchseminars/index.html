        <p>
          This year the Artificial intelligence and Robotics Society is organising exclusive access to research seminars. 
          These seminars are only available for PhDs but as a member of the society, you will get to access all sessions. 
          Research seminars cover topics from advanced computer science to engineering (including talks about artificial 
          intelligence/machine learning/robotics).
        </p>
        <p class='margin-bot'>Be aware that these sessions sometimes covers advanced topics in mathematics and/or computer science that 
          are not taught in undergraduate level.
        </p>

          <h4>Synthesizing multi-character interactions using data-driven approaches.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Character animation production pipeline still requires a lot of manual work from artists nowadays.
            Researchers in the Computer Graphics (CG) community have been trying to develop new approaches
            for the professionals in the entertainment industry such that they can focus their effort on creativity
            rather than tedious manual, repetitive tasks. With the advancement of motion capture technology
            and machine learning techniques, it is possible to develop data-driven approaches to assist artists in
            daily routine work. My research interests focus on the areas of CG and Computer Vision (CV). In
            particular, I am interested in applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques demonstrated in
            the CV community in solving research problems in CG. In this talk, I will present two recent CG projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first project, an intuitive way for controlling characters in crowd simulation using multi-
            touch devices is proposed. We propose a data-driven gesture-based crowd control system, in which

            the control scheme is learned from example gestures provided by different users. In particular, we
            build a database with pairwise samples of gestures and crowd motions. To effectively generalize the
            gesture style of different users, we propose a set of gesture features and crowd motion features that
            are extracted from a Gaussian mixture model. Given a run-time gesture, our system extracts the K
            nearest gestures from the database and interpolates the corresponding crowd motions in order to
            generate the run-time control. Our system is accurate and efficient, making it suitable for real-time
            applications such as real-time strategy games and interactive animation controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the second project, we introduce a data-driven method to generate a large number of
            plausible, closely interacting 3D human pose-pairs, for a given motion category, e.g., wrestling or salsa
            dance. With much difficulty in acquiring close interactions using 3D sensors, our approach utilizes
            abundant existing video data which cover many human activities. Instead of treating the data
            generation problem as one of reconstruction, either through 3D acquisition or direct 2D-to-3D data
            lifting from video annotations, we present a solution based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
            sampling. With a focus on efficient sampling over the space of close interactions, rather than pose
            spaces, we develop a novel representation called interaction coordinates (IC) to encode both poses
            and their interactions in an integrated manner. Plausibility of a 3D pose-pair is then defined based on
            the ICs and with respect to the annotated 2D pose-pairs from video. We show that our sampling-based
            approach is able to efficiently synthesize a large volume of plausible, closely interacting 3D pose-pairs
            which provide a good coverage of the input 2D pose-pairs.

          <h3>Rearch Seminar 2:</h3>
          <h4>Performance improvement on recommender systems in terms of prediction accuracy applied to e-commerce datasets.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Abstract: Users need to find easily the items that meet their tastes from the massive amount of items. However, for example,
            on e-commerce websites, there are many products. To find the relevant one for them is not an easy task.  Using 
            recommendation algorithms efficiently, information retrieval can be done in the most accurate way. In this work, we try 
            to find out how to deliver the most relevant items to users' interests using different machine learning algorithms and 
            methods.

          <h3>Rearch Seminar 1:</h3>
          <h4>Predicting what happens to critically ill patients in hospital with machine learning.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>Hospitals use various different scoring systems for patient monitoring that take patient vital signs as 
            their input- usually to decide level of care needed. I explore how using one of the most recent scoring systems can be used in various 
            machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient lives or dies (and more!). To find out which machine learning technique 
            was used-and the results- attend!
