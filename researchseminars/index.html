          <b>2019-2020: Research Seminar 1</b>
          <h3>On Minimisation of Treewidth and Fill-In</h3>
          <p>In graph theory, a chord is defined as an edge between a pair of non-adjacent vertices of a cycle. After the addition of a set of chords, a graph becomes triangulated if every cycle has a chord. In a minimal triangulation, the removal of any chord creates a chord-less cycle. First, we review some efficient algorithm for minimal triangulation.</p>
          <p>Second, we consider two well-studied problems in graph theory with various real-world applications. Both problems can be solved by finding specific triangulations of the input graph. The Minimum Fill-In problem is the problem of finding a triangulation with the minimum number of chords whereas the Treewidth problem corresponds to the problem of finding a triangulation such that the cliquesize (size of the largest set of pairwise adjacent vertices) is kept to a minimum. It has been proved that neither of the two problems can be solved efficiently. </p>
          <p>We overview the graph classes where the answer to the two problems differ and introduce a class of graphs that contains all the aforementioned classes. We then discuss the closely related TFM (the Treewidth and Fill-in Minimisation) problem where given a graph G, positive integers c and k the output is 'yes' if there exists a triangulation of G with cliquesize of at most k more than optimal, that has at most c many more chords than the minimum number of chords needed. We point out the values of k and c for which the TFM problem has a positive answer in our class of graphs. Finally we study some well-known graph classes where we believe the TFM problem has a positive solution for any c and k.</p>
