          <h4>Intelligent organization based on viable system model and cibernetics</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            AIM: This presentation aims to revisit cybernetics; synergize Ross Ashby’s Law of requisite variety
            and Viable System Model (VSM) in order to show its relevance as a theoretical and practical
            framework in a complex engineering organization.
            Practical implication: The application of this model under study can activate major potential for
            improvement of this key organization(CSTP-NASRDA) by improving communication, control, enhance
            decision-making within the organs of the organization and overall, making them viable systems
            within a bigger system.

          <h4>Understanding and Generating Visual Media using Machine Learning.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            In recent years, we have seen a significant trend that computer vision, which traditionally 
            focuses on image analysis and recognition, and computer graphics where the major interest is 
            to produce improved imagery, are merging. The boundary between them becomes increasingly vague 
            and both benefit significantly from recent development in machine learning. In this talk, I will
            give an overview of our recent research in this joint area which aims to develop automatic methods 
            to understand and synthesise visual media including images and 3D shapes. In particular, we focus on 
            tasks which are traditionally challenging, including image emotion analysis, image style transfer, as
            well as 3D shape deformation analysis and transfer.

          <h4>Digital health: A transformational tool for maternal and child healthcare delivery
              in Nigeria</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Digital health is a potent tool for any ambitious, sustainable and scalable health
            system. There has been widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMR)
            in most high-income countries (HICs), but this is not the case in many developing
            nations. So far, only a few of the health institutions in Nigeria have implemented
            any form of EMR system especially for the domain of maternal and child health
            (MCH).

          <h4>Private Cloud Computing Adoption and Decision Making using Knowledge Based
            System</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            The adoption of Cloud Computing (CC) and its effect on cost, technology, location, and the
            business sector has been increasingly researched. Two crucial challenges with the adoption of
            CC are the choices of deployment and service models. A comprehensive review of the
            literature revealed a lack of information addressing these models and the purpose of this
            study is to review the factors influencing, in particular, the adoption of private cloud
            computing in an organization. This paper presents a different classification of private cloud
            computing and also identifies the importance of intranet network as the bases for private CC
            implementation. Finally, the review suggests some key adoption considerations and related
            factors, as well as a future analysis of the impact of such factors on private cloud computing.

          <h4>Personalised Context Aware Suggestions</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            The TREC Contextual Suggestion track (2013-2015) addressed the problem of suggesting contextually relevant
            attractions to a user visiting a new city based on the user&#39;s preferences. In this talk I will reframe the problem of
            representing and using context and will introduce our two past approaches to capturing the user&#39;s profile to enable a
            system to provide more accurate and relevant recommendations. The results of our participation at TREC showed
            that our system not only significantly outperforms the baselines, but also achieved the best results in nearly all test
            contexts. Finally, I will show how this work has been extended to recommending mobile phone apps based on the
            user current context.

          <h4>Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            In this talk, Bo Wei will introduce his research on intelligent cyber physical systems,
            which includes two main areas: real-time recognition on resource-constrained
            devices and device-free context awareness using wireless signal.</p>
            <p>Cyber physical systems (CPS) have a wide range of applications in natural and
            urban environment monitoring. Real-time recognition on resource-constrained
            devices is critically important in CPS because wireless transmission costs several
            orders of magnitude more energy than computation. The main challenges of in-
            network classification in CPS include effective feature selection, intensive
            computation requirement and high noise levels. We propose several methods to
            address these challenges for various applications, such as acoustic classification,
            face recognition and indoor localisation.</p>
            <p>Context awareness is an important component of many pervasive computing
            applications. Device-free context awareness has the advantage that it does not have
            the privacy concern of using cameras and the subjects do not have to carry a device
            on them. We take advantage of wireless signal for device-free localisation, activity
              recognition, and identity recognition.</p>

          <h4>The quantum information supremacy of linear optics quantum interference</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Multiphoton quantum interference underpins fundamental tests of quantum
            mechanics and quantum technologies, including applications in quantum computing,
            quantum sensing and quantum communication. Standard quantum information
            processing schemes rely on the challenging need of generating a large number of
            identical photons. In this talk, we show how the difference in the photonic spectral
            properties, instead of being a drawback to overcome in experimental realisations,
            can be exploited as a remarkable quantum resource. Interestingly, we demonstrate
            how harnessing the full multiphoton quantum information stored in the photonic
            spectra by frequency and time resolved correlation measurements in linear
            interferometers enables the characterisation of multiphoton networks and states,
            produces a wide variety of multipartite entanglement, and scales-up experimental
            demonstrations of boson sampling quantum computational supremacy.  These
            results are therefore of profound interest for future applications of universal spectrally
            resolved linear optics across fundamental science and quantum technologies with
            photons with experimentally different spectral properties.

          <h4>Robotic interaction control and human-robot collaboration</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            The past decades have seen robots move out from industrial floors to daily lives. They are
            no longer confined to closed environments but now co-exist and even collaborate with
            humans in unknown dynamic environments. In this regard, we must carefully deal with the
            interaction between a robot and its environment, including humans. In this talk, I will
            introduce some previous and ongoing works on robotic interaction control and human-
            robot collaboration. Two research questions will be addressed: (i) how to design adaptive or
            learning strategies for a robot to interact with its environment including humans? (ii) how to
            best use the complementary strengths of the human and robot in a specific task? These
            research problems will be elaborated with target applications, including surface exploration,
            human-robot collaborative manipulation, robotic rehabilitation, etc. Future works and
            promising research directions will be then outlined.

          <h4>Anomaly Detection - How to Detect What We Don&#39;t Know About?</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            With processing power, data storage units and sensors getting cheaper
            and cheaper, industrial data can be gathered in greater quantities than ever before in
            sectors such as aviation, marine and manufacturing. There might be legal
            requirements to check for safety incidents, or that regulations are being complied
            with. Additionally, the data may contain valuable information on the presence of
            faults (known or unknown) or general performance degradation. Industrial sectors
            have responded differently to this challenge and require more automated methods to
            successfully extract the information required in a multitude of different environments.
            Anomaly detection methods have been proposed to tackle some of these challenges
            and in this seminar, 3 separate case studies in the aviation, the marine and the
            manufacturing sectors are discussed and results are presented from the anomaly
            detection methods applied in each case.

          <h4>Smart Robot Systems for Firefighting Tasks.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            This talk will first introduce the history of robotics and its classifications. In particular HAM (Human
            Adaptive Mechatronics) developed from one of my network projects is introduced and discussed.
            Then the challenges and future researches of robotics in disaster rescues (in particular fire-fighting)
            are revealed. It will address the part of the above challenges and will provide a review on the robot-
            assisted firefighting systems with interdisciplinary perspectives to identify the needs, requirements,
            challenges as well as future trends to facilitate smart and efficient operations. We will consider
            information acquisition (sensing and visioning technology), transmission (ultra-remote signal
            transmission) and processing (multi-sensor fusion technology), instrumentation (actuating technology,
            robotics thermal protection technology), control (multi-degree of freedom mobile and operating robot
            control methods, obstacle avoidance and sweeping, Decision Support Systems (DSS)) and
            communication (Human-Robot (H2R) interaction systems, Machine-to-Machine (M2M)). This talk will
            also introduce the basic requirements to design and develop a hybrid mobile robot and report the
            recent progress conducted by the EU funded SMOOTH project. Subsequently, prevailing firefighting
            robotic platforms in literature as well as in practices are elaborately scrutinized and discussed,
            followed by investigation of localization and navigation support methods.

          <h4>Synthesizing multi-character interactions using data-driven approaches.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Character animation production pipeline still requires a lot of manual work from artists nowadays.
            Researchers in the Computer Graphics (CG) community have been trying to develop new approaches
            for the professionals in the entertainment industry such that they can focus their effort on creativity
            rather than tedious manual, repetitive tasks. With the advancement of motion capture technology
            and machine learning techniques, it is possible to develop data-driven approaches to assist artists in
            daily routine work. My research interests focus on the areas of CG and Computer Vision (CV). In
            particular, I am interested in applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques demonstrated in
            the CV community in solving research problems in CG. In this talk, I will present two recent CG projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first project, an intuitive way for controlling characters in crowd simulation using multi-
            touch devices is proposed. We propose a data-driven gesture-based crowd control system, in which

            the control scheme is learned from example gestures provided by different users. In particular, we
            build a database with pairwise samples of gestures and crowd motions. To effectively generalize the
            gesture style of different users, we propose a set of gesture features and crowd motion features that
            are extracted from a Gaussian mixture model. Given a run-time gesture, our system extracts the K
            nearest gestures from the database and interpolates the corresponding crowd motions in order to
            generate the run-time control. Our system is accurate and efficient, making it suitable for real-time
            applications such as real-time strategy games and interactive animation controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the second project, we introduce a data-driven method to generate a large number of
            plausible, closely interacting 3D human pose-pairs, for a given motion category, e.g., wrestling or salsa
            dance. With much difficulty in acquiring close interactions using 3D sensors, our approach utilizes
            abundant existing video data which cover many human activities. Instead of treating the data
            generation problem as one of reconstruction, either through 3D acquisition or direct 2D-to-3D data
            lifting from video annotations, we present a solution based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
            sampling. With a focus on efficient sampling over the space of close interactions, rather than pose
            spaces, we develop a novel representation called interaction coordinates (IC) to encode both poses
            and their interactions in an integrated manner. Plausibility of a 3D pose-pair is then defined based on
            the ICs and with respect to the annotated 2D pose-pairs from video. We show that our sampling-based
            approach is able to efficiently synthesize a large volume of plausible, closely interacting 3D pose-pairs
            which provide a good coverage of the input 2D pose-pairs.

            Abstract: Users need to find easily the items that meet their tastes from the massive amount of items. However, for example,

            to find out how to deliver the most relevant items to users' interests using different machine learning algorithms and 
            methods.

          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>Hospitals use various different scoring systems for patient monitoring that take patient vital signs as
