          <h4>The quantum information supremacy of linear optics quantum interference</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Multiphoton quantum interference underpins fundamental tests of quantum
            mechanics and quantum technologies, including applications in quantum computing,
            quantum sensing and quantum communication. Standard quantum information
            processing schemes rely on the challenging need of generating a large number of
            identical photons. In this talk, we show how the difference in the photonic spectral
            properties, instead of being a drawback to overcome in experimental realisations,
            can be exploited as a remarkable quantum resource. Interestingly, we demonstrate
            how harnessing the full multiphoton quantum information stored in the photonic
            spectra by frequency and time resolved correlation measurements in linear
            interferometers enables the characterisation of multiphoton networks and states,
            produces a wide variety of multipartite entanglement, and scales-up experimental
            demonstrations of boson sampling quantum computational supremacy.Â  These
            results are therefore of profound interest for future applications of universal spectrally
            resolved linear optics across fundamental science and quantum technologies with
            photons with experimentally different spectral properties.

          <h4>Robotic interaction control and human-robot collaboration</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            The past decades have seen robots move out from industrial floors to daily lives. They are
            no longer confined to closed environments but now co-exist and even collaborate with
            humans in unknown dynamic environments. In this regard, we must carefully deal with the
            interaction between a robot and its environment, including humans. In this talk, I will
            introduce some previous and ongoing works on robotic interaction control and human-
            robot collaboration. Two research questions will be addressed: (i) how to design adaptive or
            learning strategies for a robot to interact with its environment including humans? (ii) how to
            best use the complementary strengths of the human and robot in a specific task? These
            research problems will be elaborated with target applications, including surface exploration,
            human-robot collaborative manipulation, robotic rehabilitation, etc. Future works and
            promising research directions will be then outlined.

          <h4>Anomaly Detection - How to Detect What We Don&#39;t Know About?</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            With processing power, data storage units and sensors getting cheaper
            and cheaper, industrial data can be gathered in greater quantities than ever before in
            sectors such as aviation, marine and manufacturing. There might be legal
            requirements to check for safety incidents, or that regulations are being complied
            with. Additionally, the data may contain valuable information on the presence of
            faults (known or unknown) or general performance degradation. Industrial sectors
            have responded differently to this challenge and require more automated methods to
            successfully extract the information required in a multitude of different environments.
            Anomaly detection methods have been proposed to tackle some of these challenges
            and in this seminar, 3 separate case studies in the aviation, the marine and the
            manufacturing sectors are discussed and results are presented from the anomaly
            detection methods applied in each case.

          <h4>Smart Robot Systems for Firefighting Tasks.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            This talk will first introduce the history of robotics and its classifications. In particular HAM (Human
            Adaptive Mechatronics) developed from one of my network projects is introduced and discussed.
            Then the challenges and future researches of robotics in disaster rescues (in particular fire-fighting)
            are revealed. It will address the part of the above challenges and will provide a review on the robot-
            assisted firefighting systems with interdisciplinary perspectives to identify the needs, requirements,
            challenges as well as future trends to facilitate smart and efficient operations. We will consider
            information acquisition (sensing and visioning technology), transmission (ultra-remote signal
            transmission) and processing (multi-sensor fusion technology), instrumentation (actuating technology,
            robotics thermal protection technology), control (multi-degree of freedom mobile and operating robot
            control methods, obstacle avoidance and sweeping, Decision Support Systems (DSS)) and
            communication (Human-Robot (H2R) interaction systems, Machine-to-Machine (M2M)). This talk will
            also introduce the basic requirements to design and develop a hybrid mobile robot and report the
            recent progress conducted by the EU funded SMOOTH project. Subsequently, prevailing firefighting
            robotic platforms in literature as well as in practices are elaborately scrutinized and discussed,
            followed by investigation of localization and navigation support methods.

          <h4>Synthesizing multi-character interactions using data-driven approaches.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Character animation production pipeline still requires a lot of manual work from artists nowadays.
            Researchers in the Computer Graphics (CG) community have been trying to develop new approaches
            for the professionals in the entertainment industry such that they can focus their effort on creativity
            rather than tedious manual, repetitive tasks. With the advancement of motion capture technology
            and machine learning techniques, it is possible to develop data-driven approaches to assist artists in
            daily routine work. My research interests focus on the areas of CG and Computer Vision (CV). In
            particular, I am interested in applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques demonstrated in
            the CV community in solving research problems in CG. In this talk, I will present two recent CG projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first project, an intuitive way for controlling characters in crowd simulation using multi-
            touch devices is proposed. We propose a data-driven gesture-based crowd control system, in which

            the control scheme is learned from example gestures provided by different users. In particular, we
            build a database with pairwise samples of gestures and crowd motions. To effectively generalize the
            gesture style of different users, we propose a set of gesture features and crowd motion features that
            are extracted from a Gaussian mixture model. Given a run-time gesture, our system extracts the K
            nearest gestures from the database and interpolates the corresponding crowd motions in order to
            generate the run-time control. Our system is accurate and efficient, making it suitable for real-time
            applications such as real-time strategy games and interactive animation controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the second project, we introduce a data-driven method to generate a large number of
            plausible, closely interacting 3D human pose-pairs, for a given motion category, e.g., wrestling or salsa
            dance. With much difficulty in acquiring close interactions using 3D sensors, our approach utilizes
            abundant existing video data which cover many human activities. Instead of treating the data
            generation problem as one of reconstruction, either through 3D acquisition or direct 2D-to-3D data
            lifting from video annotations, we present a solution based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
            sampling. With a focus on efficient sampling over the space of close interactions, rather than pose
            spaces, we develop a novel representation called interaction coordinates (IC) to encode both poses
            and their interactions in an integrated manner. Plausibility of a 3D pose-pair is then defined based on
            the ICs and with respect to the annotated 2D pose-pairs from video. We show that our sampling-based
            approach is able to efficiently synthesize a large volume of plausible, closely interacting 3D pose-pairs
            which provide a good coverage of the input 2D pose-pairs.

          <h4>Performance improvement on recommender systems in terms of prediction accuracy applied to e-commerce datasets.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>
            Abstract: Users need to find easily the items that meet their tastes from the massive amount of items. However, for example,
            on e-commerce websites, there are many products. To find the relevant one for them is not an easy task.  Using 
            recommendation algorithms efficiently, information retrieval can be done in the most accurate way. In this work, we try 
            to find out how to deliver the most relevant items to users' interests using different machine learning algorithms and 
            methods.

          <h4>Predicting what happens to critically ill patients in hospital with machine learning.</h4>
          <u>Summary:</u>
          <p>Hospitals use various different scoring systems for patient monitoring that take patient vital signs as 
            their input- usually to decide level of care needed. I explore how using one of the most recent scoring systems can be used in various 
            machine learning techniques to predict whether a patient lives or dies (and more!). To find out which machine learning technique 
            was used-and the results- attend!
