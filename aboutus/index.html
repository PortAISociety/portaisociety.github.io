            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>The Artificial Intelligence & Robotics society is open to anyone, regardless of ability level, that wants to learn more about and get hands on with the latest technology in the field.</p>
            <p>We believe in collaborative, practical learning in a fun and engaging manner so come along to our free informative sessions where you’ll be able to learn about Neural Networks, Genetic Programming, Automation and more!</p>
            <p>Every term we host our <em>Student Showcase</em> - an opportunity for you to present a project or application that you’ve been working on in front of peers, allowing you to get feedback, start a discussion or to teach others.</p>
            <p>As a member of the society you can also look forward to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attending events and competitions throughout the year</li>
                <li>Trips to industry (last year we visited IBM Southbank)</li>
                <li>Guest Speakers - both academics and professionals</li>
                <li>Opportunity to attend <a href="../researchseminars">PhD Research Seminars</a>, usually exclusively for academic staff (these are held in the hour before our normal sessions)</li>
                <li>Social events - a chance to network & have fun with peers in a relaxed environment</li>
            </ul>
