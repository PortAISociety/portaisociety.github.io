            <h3>A tryst with Upper Arm Exoskeleton</h3>
            <div class="session-information-blue">
                <p><b>Speaker: Prof Venky Dubey</b></p>
                <p><b>Date: 19/02/2019</b></p>

            <p>There have been many upper arm exoskeletons developed in the last two decades
                however none of these have met the expectations of the real users. Most of these designs did not
                go beyond the laboratory environment and were mainly used either as a research tool or as

                experimental devices for a very specific application. The majority of these devices were platform-
                based that was one of the main inhibiting factors why users found such devices too cumbersome

                to use. This talk will present a tryst with new design based on anatomical arm and attempt to
                address what could be the technical requirements and what user interface should be provided to
                enhance their acceptability.</p>

            <h3>Having Secure Co-owned Data Sharing Processes in Online Social Networks</h3>
            <div class="session-information-blue">
                <p><b>Speaker: Gulsum Akkuzu</b></p>
                <p><b>Date: 05/02/2019</b></p>

            <p>Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become one of the most popular platforms for people
                to share information with others without considering their locations. OSNs have brought
                appreciable benefits to people's lives, such as facilitating the way of communication,
                real-time information about people, businesses and lifestyle. However, OSNs have also
                brought some serious threats to our lives. One of those threats is the threat of privacy
                breaches of everyday activities and business transactions. The majority of these privacy
                risks come from the sharing of co-owned data; when a user shares data related to and
                generated by multiple users, that user might cause privacy issues to those co-owners. The
                main problem in such cases is that the decision to share is taken by one user who uploads
                the content of the data to OSN platforms. Such a decision should ideally be the outcome of
                every other user involved in the data content. Designing collaborative privacy management
                systems have attracted much research attention. However, privacy issues remain unsolved
                as yet.</p>

            <h3>Rule Control of Teleo-Reactive, Multi-tasking, Communicating Robotic Agents</h3>
            <div class="session-information-blue">
                <p><b>Speaker: Prof Keith Clark, Imperial College London</b></p>
                <p><b>Date: 29/01/2019</b></p>
                <p><b>Time: 14:00-15:00</b></p>
                <p><b>Location: Buckingham Building 0.20</b></p>
            </div>
            <p>The robotic agents are programmed in two rule based languages: QuLog  and TeleoR. They communicate using a logic based pub/sub and addressed message routing server, Pedro.</p>
            <p>QuLog is a flexibly typed rule language for programming multi-threaded communicating agents. Its declarative subset of relation and function defining rules is used for encoding an agent’s dynamic beliefs and static knowledge. Its imperative rules are used for implementing an agent’s multi-threaded architecture, for updating the dynamic beliefs, and for inter-agent communication.</p>
            <p>TeleoR is an application specific extension of QuLog for programming task threads that control robotic devices. It is a major extension of the T-R language proposed by Nils Nilsson., itself a descendant of  generalised hierarchical triangular table action plans of the first cognitive robot Shakey.</p>
            <p>TeleoR programs comprise sequences of guarded robotic action rules, G ~&gt; A, clustered into parameterised procedures. G is a QuLog query to the agent&#39;s dynamic beliefs. A is a robotic action, optionally paired with an agent action, or it is a call to a TeleoR procedure, including a recursive call.</p>

      <h3>Using machine learning to analyse student assessment feedback</h3>
      <div class="session-information-blue">
        <p><b>Speaker: Zainab Mutlaq-Ibrahim</b></p>
        <p><b>Date: 22/01/2019</b></p>

        <p><b>Location: Buckingham Building 0.20</b></p>
      </div>
      <p>Assessment constitutes a fundamental part of an academic Learning process due to its importance in testing students gaining knowledge and finalizing their grades. This study aims to develop a data mining based framework for analysing students' assessment feedback that will be obtained from social media sites and/or text feedback such as end of unit feedback. The study consists of three stages: The first stage is to build a model that automatically detect the polarity of student feedback using sentiment analysis methods.</p>
      <p>The second stage is to build a model that automatically identify and classify issues of assessment. And finally, test the correlation between issue(s) and students' performance. </p>
      <p>The research uses Support Vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for text classification to analyse students' feedback of assessment to enhance learning process.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The overall evidence for the impact of electronic information systems on cost, quality and safety of healthcare remains contested. Whilst it seems intuitively obvious that having more data about a patient will improve care, the mechanisms by which information availability is translated into better decision-making are not well understood. Furthermore, there is the risk of data overload creating a negative outcome. There are situations where a key information summary can be more useful than a rich record.</p>

      <h3>Enabling local people and groups to support global organisational development</h3>
      <p>Our organisations emerge from networks of autonomous people engaged in interaction processes
        (Espejo &amp; Foss, 2018). People, in collectives, use their skills, resources and capabilities to create
        and produce whatever outcomes they may wish to achieve. Collaboration in these interactions, to a
        significant degree, depend on processes of self-organization. In general there is no one with
        authority to tell people what to do and how to interact; they just interact. Often these interactions are
        inadequate and it is only through learning processes, which depend on cues and signals, that they
        proceed towards desirable outcomes. To a degree this is the dynamics of organisational
        development to respond to environmental, social, and economic pressures. Self-organising
        processes are at the core of their interactions. In today’s world technologies, digital and others, are
        transforming these interaction processes. New forms of communication and relationships are
        emerging between people and their environments; these are processes towards the constitution of
        effective organisational systems (Beer, 1979, 1985), (Espejo &amp; Reyes, 2011). However, these
        systems are more than the outcome of bottom-up self-organisation; they are also, the outcome of
        guided self-organisation, which, through policies clarify purposes and help to speed up learning
        processes by enabling relating fragmented resources. Organisational development and problem
        solving require of both; bottom-up and top-down interactions. The challenge is working out which
        interaction strategies are necessary to increase response capacity to make sense of an often
        overwhelmingly complex surrounding. These are aspects related to Ross Ashby´s law of requisite
        variety (Ashby, 1964). We learn to manage these interactions often at a high cost to people and
        organisation; hierarchical structures tend to concentrate responses to environmental challenges at
        the top of the organisation. On the other hand heterarchical organisations try to distribute response
        capacity and self-organisation throughout the collective, but often their local response capacity is
        limited by resources. However, current information and communications technologies are increasing the
        chances of making this distribution effective.</p>

      <b>2019-2020: Research Seminar 1</b>
      <h3>On Minimisation of Treewidth and Fill-In</h3>
      <p>In graph theory, a chord is defined as an edge between a pair of non-adjacent vertices of a cycle. After the addition of a set of chords, a graph becomes triangulated if every cycle has a chord. In a minimal triangulation, the removal of any chord creates a chord-less cycle. First, we review some efficient algorithm for minimal triangulation.</p>
      <p>Second, we consider two well-studied problems in graph theory with various real-world applications. Both problems can be solved by finding specific triangulations of the input graph. The Minimum Fill-In problem is the problem of finding a triangulation with the minimum number of chords whereas the Treewidth problem corresponds to the problem of finding a triangulation such that the cliquesize (size of the largest set of pairwise adjacent vertices) is kept to a minimum. It has been proved that neither of the two problems can be solved efficiently. </p>
      <p>We overview the graph classes where the answer to the two problems differ and introduce a class of graphs that contains all the aforementioned classes. We then discuss the closely related TFM (the Treewidth and Fill-in Minimisation) problem where given a graph G, positive integers c and k the output is 'yes' if there exists a triangulation of G with cliquesize of at most k more than optimal, that has at most c many more chords than the minimum number of chords needed. We point out the values of k and c for which the TFM problem has a positive answer in our class of graphs. Finally we study some well-known graph classes where we believe the TFM problem has a positive solution for any c and k.</p>
